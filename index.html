          I'm a guy who loves everything computer- and technology-related.<br>
          I currently live in beautiful Havstenssund in Sweden with my wife and our lovely daughters.
          I'm working as a software developer at <a href="http://www.swedspot.com/">Swedspot</a> where i've been working at since june 2016.

          Projects
        </h2>

        <p>I have been involved in several projects at Swedspot where some of them can be seen at <a href="http://www.swedspot.com/">the company website</a> or at the Apple App Store.</p>

        <p>Some projects i've been working on through my education at Chalmers are:  </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            A <a href="https://github.com/marcustrigell/yep">Yeopardy game done with Java Spring backend and React frontend</a>.<br>
          </li>
          <li>
            A <a href="https://github.com/marcustrigell/movie-finder">movie-search app for Android</a>.<br>
          </li>
          <li>
            A music player for Volvo Trucks implemented in Android with NHTSA-guidelines and vehicle safety as main priority.    This was a project in collaboration with Volvo, Swedspot and some other companies at Lindholmen Science Park in Gothenburg and the source code is private unfortunately.<br>
          </li>
        </ul>
